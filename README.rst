Introduction: What is Nety?
=====================================

Nety is a Python_ library, which parses through Cisco IOS-style
(and other vendor) configurations.  It can:

- Audit existing router / switch / firewall / wlc configurations
- Retrieve portions of the configuration
- Modify existing configurations
- Build new configurations

The library examines an IOS-style config and breaks it into a set of linked
parent / child relationships.  You can perform complex queries about these
relationships.

What if we don't use Cisco?
===========================

Don't let that stop you.

As of Nety 1.2.4, you can parse `brace-delimited configurations`_
into a Cisco IOS style (see `Github Issue #17`_), which means that
Nety understands these configurations:

- Juniper Networks Junos, and Screenos
- F5 Networks configurations

Nety also handles anything that has a Cisco IOS style of configuration, which includes:

- Cisco IOS, Cisco Nexus, Cisco IOS-XR, Cisco IOS-XE, Aironet OS, Cisco ASA, Cisco CatOS
- Arista EOS
- Brocade
- HP Switches
- Force 10 Switches
- Dell PowerConnect Switches
- Extreme Networks
- Enterasys

.. _Pre-Requisites:

Pre-requisites
==============

Nety_ requires Python versions 3.5+ (We no longer support Python 2.x); the OS should not
matter. If you want to run it under a Python virtualenv_, it's been heavily
tested in that environment as well.

.. _Installation:

Installation and Downloads
==========================

The best way to get Nety is with setuptools_ or pip_.  If you
already have setuptools_, you can install as usual:

::

      # Substitute whatever Nety version you like...
      easy_install -U nety==1.3.0

Alternatively you can install into Python2.x with pip_:

::

      pip install --upgrade Nety

Use ``pip3`` for Python3.x...

::

      pip3 install --upgrade Nety

Otherwise `download it from PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Nety>`_, extract it and run the ``setup.py`` script:

::

      python setup.py install

If you're interested in the source, you can always pull from the `github repo`_:


- From github_:
  ::

      git clone https://github.com/YtenSoftware/Nety.git


.. _FAQ:

FAQ
===

#) *QUESTION*: I want to use Nety_ with Python3; is that safe?  *ANSWER*: As long as you're using Python 3.3 or higher, it's safe. I test every release against Python 3.2+; however, Python 3.2 is currently exposed to a small bug for some configurations (see `Github Issue #14`_).

#) *QUESTION*: Some of the code in the documentation looks different than what I'm used to seeing.  Did you change something?  *ANSWER*: Yes, starting around Nety_ v0.9.10 I introducted more methods directly on ``IOSConfigLine()`` objects; going forward, these methods are the preferred way to use Nety_.  Please start using the new methods shown in the example, since they're faster, and you type much less code this way.

#) *QUESTION*: Nety_ saved me a lot of time, I want to give money.  Do you have a donation link?  *ANSWER*:  I love getting emails like this; helping people get their jobs done is why I wrote the module.  However, I'm not accepting donations.

#) *QUESTION*: Is there a way to use this module with perl?  *ANSWER*: Yes, I do this myself. Install the python package as you normally would and import it into perl with ``Inline.pm`` and ``Inline::Python`` from CPAN.

#) *QUESTION*: When I use ``find_children("interface GigabitEthernet3/2")``, I'm getting all interfaces beginning with 3/2, including 3/21, 3/22, 3/23 and 3/24. How can I limit my results?  *ANSWER*: There are two ways... the simplest is to use the 'exactmatch' option...  ``find_children("interface GigabitEthernet3/2", exactmatch=True)``. Another way is to utilize regex expansion that is native to many methods... ``find_children("interface GigabitEthernet3/2$")``
